//121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
//given an array 'prices' - where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i-th day
//want to maximize profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock
//and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock
//return the max profit you can achieve from transaction
//if you cannot achieve any profit - return 0

//set the first price as currMin and currMax as 0 and keep updating 
//need to compare between current price and updated currMin
//need to compare between currMax and the difference between price and currMin

  //between the prices[i] and currMin for minimum value
  //between the currmax and prices[i] - currMin for maximum value
