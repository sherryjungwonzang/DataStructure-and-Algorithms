//1328. Break a Palindrome
//given a palindromic string of lowercase English letters 'palindrome'
//replace exacly one character with any lowercase english letter so that the resulting string is not a palindrome
//and that is is the lexicographically smallest one possible

//return the resulting string
//if there is no way to replace a character to make it not a palindrome
//return an empty string

//a string 'a' is lexicographically smaller than a string 'b' of the same length
//if in the first position where a and b differs
//a has a character strictly smaller than the corresponding character in b

//ex: "abcc" is lexicographically smaller than "abcd"
//because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and 'c' is smaller than 'd'
var breakPalindrome = (palindrome) => {
    //base case

    //1. create an array from palindrome
    let arr = palindrome.split(""); //splitting by words

    //2. looping through to the half
