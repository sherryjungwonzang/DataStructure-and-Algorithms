//1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences
//given a string 's' consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'
//in a single step, you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s
//return the min number of steps to make the given string empty

//a string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order
//a string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward
var removePalindromicSubsequences = (s) => {

    }
}
removePalindromicSubsequences("ababa"); //1 - s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step
//"a b a b a" -> reverse: "a b a b a"
//palindrome -> return 1

removePalindromicSubsequences("abb"); //2 - "abb" -> "bb" -> ""
//"a b b" -> reverse: "b b a"
//not palindrome -> return 2
