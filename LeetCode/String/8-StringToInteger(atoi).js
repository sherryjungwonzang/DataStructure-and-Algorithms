//8. String to Integer(atoi)
//implement myAtoi(string s) function - converts a string to 32-bit signed integer

//read-in and ignore any leading whitespace
//check if the next character is '-' or '+'
//read this character in if iti is either
//determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively
//assume the result of positive if neither is present

//read in the next characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached
//the rest of the string is ignored

//convert these digits into an integer - ex: "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32
//if no digits were read, then the integer is 0
//change the sign as necessary

//if the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer rance [-2^31, 2^31 - 1]
//then clamp the integer so that is remains in the range
//specifically, integers less than -2^31 should be clamped to -2^31
//and integers greater than 2^31 - 1 should be clamped to 2^31 - 1

//return the integer as the final result

//only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character
//do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits

//Approach:
//having 'must do' - 5 steps
var myAtoi = (str) => {
    let index = 0; //counting the whitespace index
    let isNeg = false;
    let res = 0;

    //Step 1 - check and remove any leading white spaces
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        if (str[i] === " ") {
            index++;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    //Step 2 - check signed - or +
    if (str[index] === '-' || str[index] === '+') {
        isNeg = str[index] === '-'; //update isNeg after checking
        index++; //to move forward
    }

    //Step 3 - loop through integers within string
    //.charCodeAt() - returns an integer between 0 and 65535 representing UTF-16 code at the given index
    for (let i = index; i < str.length; i++) {
        let num = str.charCodeAt(i) - 48; //the value is between 0 and 9

        if (num < 0 || num > 9) break;

        res *= 10;
        res += num;
    }

    //Step 4 - convert to negative based on the Step 2
    if (isNeg) res = -res;

    //Step 5 - bind it to upperbound and lowerbound
    let min = -(2 ** 31);
    let max = 2 ** 31 - 1;

    let minimum = Math.min(max, res);

    return Math.max(minimum, min);
