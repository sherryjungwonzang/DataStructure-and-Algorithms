//841. Keys and Rooms
//there are n rooms labeled from 0 to n-1 and all rooms are locked except for room 0
//goal is to visit all the rooms
//cannot enter a locked room without having its key

//when you visit a room, may not find a set of disticnt keys in it
//each key has a number on it - denoting which room it unlocks
//can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms

//given an array 'rooms' - where rooms[i] is the set of keys that can obtain if you visited room i
//return true if you can visit all the rooms, otherwise false

//Approach:
//using DFS with recursive calls
